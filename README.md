# 4HC3 Research Study

* This was a project done for a course used to test user accuracy and performance over multiple devices (mouse, trackpad, and touchpad).
The program uses mutiple classes - it is a simple maze test with sound effects to allow the user to scroll through the maze, and output and feedback regarding time and performance is stored and formatted in a simple textfile; maze found below:
